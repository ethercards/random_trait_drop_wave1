| Reroll Specific Layers | mrbrownwhale & others | This trait rerolls a specific layer on your card. With a higher chance of rerolling into the artist of your unique artwork (if Alpha or OG). The trait is burned when used. |
| Swap | Booyah2 | Allows to replace your card from another card of the same class from the vault (availability, T&C applies |
| Golden Goose | Booyah2 | this trait will drop a mystery bag for free every time Ether Cards holds a Mystery Bag event.|
| Redeem | booyah2 | Consume this trait to be sent a physical Ether Card with your cards artwork. |
| Unstable | Eskalexia | Each time the card is traded on Open Sea (or changes wallets) a random trait changes to a random trait |
| True Name | Eskalexia | Enables the holders of this trait to name their Ether.Cards/Accidental Collabs |
| Warp Rabbit | PipsquEECS | It’s a play on @bitsikka’s autonomous trait idea, but simplified without the autonomous part. So credit goes to him for inspiration too. Basically, it’s a trait where you can activate it. Then it does an action based on probabilities based on the state of your card/wallet. Maybe it has a chance to drop a basic trait if you only have Founders. Maybe it has a chance to add to your dust if you’re near empty. Maybe if you burned a lot of cards in the forge, it drops an angry NFT calling you an arsonist. But yeah, after the randomly chosen effect, it disappears and selects a new card to appear in. And the cycle starts over. This probably needs some thought on how to append data to the chain after the fact so that the trait can be refilled in the case of consumables like NFT drops. The name comes from trying to remember something that hops around and a Pixar short came to mind. |
