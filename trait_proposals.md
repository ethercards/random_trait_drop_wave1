# Trait Proposals

| Name | Submitter | Description | Technically feasible |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fluid | Sonic | Card is able to reroll layers (and maybe traits) once a month |
| Selective Layer Reroll | mrbrownwhale & others | This trait rerolls the selected layers on your card. (Maybe with a higher chance of rerolling into the artist of your unique artwork (if Alpha or OG)). The trait is burned when used. |
| Swap | Booyah2 | Allows to replace your card from another card of the same class from the vault (availability, T&C applies |
| Golden Goose | Booyah2 | this trait will drop a mystery bag for free every time Ether Cards holds a Mystery Bag event.|
| Redeem | booyah2 | Consume this trait to be sent a physical Ether Card with your cards artwork. (T&C applies) |
| Unstable (exp) | Eskalexia | Each time the card is traded on Open Sea (or changes wallets) a random trait changes to a random trait |
| True Name | Eskalexia | Enables the holders of this trait to name their Ether.Cards/Accidental Collabs |
| Warp Rabbit (exp)| PipsquEECS | It’s a play on @bitsikka’s autonomous trait idea, but simplified without the autonomous part. So credit goes to him for inspiration too. Basically, it’s a trait where you can activate it. Then it does an action based on probabilities based on the state of your card/wallet. Maybe it has a chance to drop a basic trait if you only have Founders. Maybe it has a chance to add to your dust if you’re near empty. Maybe if you burned a lot of cards in the forge, it drops an angry NFT calling you an arsonist. But yeah, after the randomly chosen effect, it disappears and selects a new card to appear in. And the cycle starts over. This probably needs some thought on how to append data to the chain after the fact so that the trait can be refilled in the case of consumables like NFT drops. The name comes from trying to remember something that hops around and a Pixar short came to mind. |
| Synthesis Ritual | PipsquEECS | use the grid to create a forgeable layer set. Details later.|
| Merch | ORDO | Some cards can get a special trait that can be burned for a physical item ( ethercards hoodie, etc ) (shipping fees apply) |
| New Fan | Linehacker | a vanity trait that moves to the card of the most recent purchaser/recipient for each artist. Additionally, each artist would have the option to customize “their” trait with some reward, drop, etc. |
| Gravity (exp)| scorpiomoon | a card with gravity trait will attract cards sacrificed by the forge, and perhaps some additional perks. The goal could be to evolve your gravity to be a supermassive black hole that sucks up all kinds of awesome stuff. |
| New Commons | Empath Acrobat | Rerolls only common layers, maybe allowing you to choose of one of two choices for each. |
| Glittery | ramaraje | glitter layer or animated layer added to the existing ether card - currently we have all static layer so may be a glittery or animated layers can be added as a special trait - during competitions or to the winners in the competitions |
| 1 UP | thecampkid | once you burn this trait you get an extra Life to use in Royal or Punks battle |
| Good Company | Alvaro | If you burn this trait you will receive another card from the vault (T&C applies) |
